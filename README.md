# Break Timer
Stuck at a computer all day? Use this handy web app to remind you to take breaks regularly. I wrote this in my spare time after realizing I don't take nearly enough breaks when programming. Hopefully it helps you too!

## How do I use it?
1. Click the website link in the `About` area to use the current instance deployed to GitHub Pages, or run it locally in your own .NET environment.
2. Use `Setup` to configure your preferred work/break intervals.
3. Start working. A bell sound will play when work or break time is over.
